With this plugin you may apply a wide selection of functions to cartographic layers in order to transform their data into meaning. This technique is used in the context of Indexes composed by several criteria (for example when working with AHP or ANP or making vulnerability indexes). It scales all layers involved into values between 0 and 1, so criteria may be aggregated. This is useful for mapping knowledge from different experts.

Parameters of the functions are adjusted to be small numbers for the purpose of using this tool in participatory workshops. The actual formulas used for each transformation are displayed below the plot and exported as a json file when the results are saved.
